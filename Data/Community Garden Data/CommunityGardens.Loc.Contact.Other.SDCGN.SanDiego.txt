Looking for space to grow your Organic veggies, fruits, berries, herbs, flowers etc?
I have a little 1 acre farm in Rainbow with space for you to grow!
Flat land has been fallow (uncultivated) for many years. I have not sprayed or applied any chemicals (pesticides or fertilizers) to the land so it is technically organic but it has not yet been "certified" organic.
I had a little family of Alpacas and applied their manure/"beans" over a two year period so the land has been organically supplemented.
Fully fenced and secure but easily accessed off the main road in the center of town, right across from the school at RAINBOW VALLEY GARDENS: 5226 Fifth Street, Rainbow, CA 92028
Large 25 x 50 foot greenhouse with roll-up sides is also available.
Fenced Outdoor Plots are suitable for poultry...CHICKENS and their EGGS! or small animals...GOATS and their MILK!
Tons of supplies to DESIGN YOUR OWN SPACE!! I have recycled wood, drip lines, containers, wood boxes, metal strapping, etc that can be utilized to create your space...feel free to build up and out to maximize the area allowing you to grow everything you desire!
Hydroponics will work!
SPIN Farming will work!
OPEN OUTDOOR PLOTS:  .10/sqft
FENCED OUTDOOR (suitable for Poultry/Sm. Animals):  .20/sqft

There is a $5 dollar key deposit, with four mandatory annual meetings. Meetings are held  the last Saturday of every month, unless otherwise noticed.

The mission of the Westminster Community Garden is to engage, inspire, and transform both individuals and the community across neighborhoods and generations while growing a sustainable garden. Those who began the garden envisioned the site as a place to educate individuals by providing classes, workshops, and information pertaining to community gardens and to provide a place of beauty and peace that can be nourishing for the body, mind, and soul. In addition to Westminster church members and Point Loma Nazarene University students, faculty, and staff, those involved hope to reach out to local schools and businesses and the PLNU community. In addition, the Westminster Community Garden will dedicate part of their produce to provide food for neighbors just down the street and across the city – the group has committed to donating 20 percent of the food produced to be shared with Presbyterian Urban Ministries and/or food banks serving those struggling to afford food in San Diego.

Greely Gardens is a community garden located in the neighborhood of "Logan Heights" in San Diego, California.  Our neighborhood lacks community and public spaces where we can grow food or attend workshops that empower the community.  In the Spring of 2014, we began creating a community garden.  We had no financial resources to buy or build many things but we've been diligently working on acquiring donations.  We currently have some seasonal produce growing on movable planters as well as one wooden planter.  We want to expand.  The space we currently use is quite large so we'd love to acquire resources to make it flourish even more.  Our neighborhood is filled with children and families that don't have much options for healthier choices of eating.  Our aim is to educate, demonstrate and provide a plot of land for people that are interested to grow their own food.

The College Area Community Garden is an all-volunteer organic garden emphasizing sustainability, urban farming and good land stewardship. We're now leasing raised beds to college area residents and SDSU students, faculty and staff who first become garden members.  After more than two years of work, a dedicated all volunteer elected board oversaw major site prep work, continues to engage in fundraising, directed a small army of volunteers furnishing over two thousand hours of labor, then opened our  garden this past summer (2014). With an efficient water delivery system and 105 total raised beds installed, about 20% of the beds are now planted and are thriving.  All remaining raised beds available for leasing are ready to go with water faucets nearby and are filled with hi quality (donated) certified organic soil. We also have a thriving orchard with 18 fruit trees.
 
    Please see our website   www.collegeareagarden.org  for more details as well as how to  become a member of,  or donate to,  our  "Hidden Valley" garden.   (revised: November, 2014)

Black Mt. Middle School Garden is growing larger, with the help of our parents and community helpers.  The garden is now being built with longevity in mind and a permanent walking path in the designs, as well, as benches for students and staff to eat and enjoy.
As in the past, we will continue to donate all of our produce to Back Yard Produce, a nonprofit organization, helping those in need with fresh produce.  Our long term goal is to create a salad bar for the staff, composting for the campus, continue with cross curriculum academics in the garden, community service/building, keeping the garden as a class for students, creating two gardening clubs, and  beautify our campus.
Thank you!
