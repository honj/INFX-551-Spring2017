# INFX 551 Data Curation Protocol Project: Local Food Systems
   Team members: Julia, Ben and Frederick
## Project Description
### 1. Topic
   We are interested in data on Local Food Systems (LFS) in the United States. Also known as community food systems, regional food systems, and sustainable local food systems, this set of terms describes a system that "integrates food production, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal to enhance the environmental, economic, social and nutritional health of a particular place." [1] While there is no established definition of "local," Congress established that local/regional food must be from in-state or travel no more than 400 miles from its point of production. "Local" can also refer to market structures, such as direct to consumer or direct to food service arrangements. [2] While we expect that there is little data that is explicitly labeled as "local food system" data, data exists related to the range activities that encompass LFS, such as: urban agriculture, farmers' markets, food deserts, community gardening, community supported agriculture, etc. 
### 2. User community
  + Potential users of this data can be divided into two broad categories: Persons who would use the data for the purpose of research for academic work, policy making, and in other areas, and persons working in local or other food economies. Also, consumers and other community members may have an interest in certain portions of this data.  
  + Research users include policy makers; researchers in the areas of urban planning, nutrition, sustainability, and other areas; activists; and public health professionals.     
  + Professional users include growers as well as others in the food sector (for example farmers' market managers and people working in restaurants and food sourcing).
### 3. Potential data
  + National Farmers Market Directory (USDA) (https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/farmersmarkets)
  + On-Farm Directory (USDA) (https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/onfarm)
  + Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) Directory (USDA) (https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/csas)
  + Farming Concrete Data (https://farmingconcrete.org/mill/)
  + CSA database (Local Harvest) (https://www.localharvest.org/csa/)
  + City open data on community gardens, etc. (e.g. data.seattle.gov, City of Chicago data portal)
### 4. Potential curation activities
  + Normalizing place names, assigning geospatial coordinates to locations in datasets
  + Assessing consistency of data collection practices across datasets
  + Working to normalize datasets coming from different municipalities or local governments
