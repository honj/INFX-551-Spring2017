# Local Food Systems Data Curation Protocol
## 1. Definition
We are interested in data on Local Food Systems (LFS) in the United States.  
Sometimes called community food systems, regional food systems, or sustainable local food systems, the term as we use it describes a system that "integrates food production, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal to enhance the environmental, economic, social and nutritional health of a particular place" [1]. The term "local" can be interpreted in many different ways. Congress established that local/regional food must be from in-state or travel no more than 400 miles from its point of production. "Local" can also refer to market structures, such as direct to consumer or direct to food service arrangements. [2] While we expect that there is little data that is explicitly labeled as "local food system" data, data exists related to a range of activities that encompass LFS, such as: urban agriculture, farmers' markets, food deserts, community gardening, community supported agriculture, etc.

## 3. Audience
Potential users of this data can be divided into two broad categories: Persons who would use the data for research related to academic work, policy-making, and other areas; and persons working in local or other food economies. Consumers and other community members may also have an interest in certain datasets.
+ Research users include policy makers; researchers in the areas of urban planning, nutrition, sustainability, and other areas; activists; and public health professionals.     
+ Professional users include growers as well as others in the food sector (for example, farmers' market managers and people working in restaurants and food sourcing).
