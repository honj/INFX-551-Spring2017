# Local Food Systems Data Curation Protocol
## 1. Definition
We are interested in data on Local Food Systems (LFS) in the United States.  
We define this in the following way...
## 2. Scope
The scope of the data that we will collect...  
While we expect that there is little data that is explicitly labeled as "local food system" data, data exists related to a range of activities that encompass LFS, such as: urban agriculture, farmers' markets, food deserts, community gardening, community supported agriculture, etc.
## 3. Audience
Potential users of this data can be divided into two broad categories: Persons who would use the data for research related to academic work, policy-making, and other areas; and persons working in local or other food economies. Consumers and other community members may also have an interest in certain datasets.
+ Research users include policy makers; researchers in the areas of urban planning, nutrition, sustainability, and other areas; activists; and public health professionals.     
+ Professional users include growers as well as others in the food sector (for example, farmers' market managers and people working in restaurants and food sourcing).
