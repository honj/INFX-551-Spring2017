## 1. Definition
We are interested in data on Local Food Systems (LFS) in the United States. As an introduction to this concept, we like the following definition of local food put forth by the National Center for Appropriate Technology's ATTRA Sustainable Agriculture Program: "Local food is food that is grown within a reasonable distance from where it is eaten. Exactly how local food is defined is as varied as the consumers that buy it. The commonality amongst local food consumers is a commitment to purchase food that ensures social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Buying local food reduces the number of "food miles" between farm and plate, and helps to keep agricultural profits in the local economy" [1].
## 2. Scope
The scope of the data that we will collect...  
While we expect that there is little data that is explicitly labeled as "local food system" data, data exists related to a range of activities that encompass LFS, such as: urban agriculture, farmers' markets, food deserts, community gardening, community supported agriculture, etc.
## 3. Data consumers
We anticipate that users of this data will fall into one of three broad categories: Persons who would use the data for research related to academic work, policy-making, and other areas; entrepreneurs, businesspeople, and others working in a food economy; and consumers and other community members who have an interest in the issue.
+ Research users include policy makers; researchers in the areas of urban planning, nutrition, sustainability, and other areas; activists; and public health professionals.     
+ Professional users include growers as well as others in the food sector (for example, farmers' market managers and people working in restaurants and food sourcing).
+ Interested consumers may include...
